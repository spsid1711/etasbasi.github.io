title: How to Begin Programming

***

##Start from basic languages

Personally, I started from HTML, a markup language used to design websites. It wasn't hard, so I didn't get bored. Which is important because a lot of people stop studying programming because it is boring for them or they can not succeed on it.

##Study Online

One can learn computer programming by himself at home because the only thing you need is a computer. There are many online websites that offer free courses. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/), and [udacity](https://www.udacity.com) are a few examples of these.
