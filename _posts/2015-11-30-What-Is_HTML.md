title: How to Begin Programming
---

##Start from basic languages
***
Personally, I started from HTML, a markup language used to design websites. It wasn't hard, so I didn't get bored. Which is important because a lot of people stop studying programming because it is boring for them or they can not succeed on it.

##Study Online
***
One can learn computer programming by himself at home because the only thing you need is a computer. There are many online websites that offer free courses. [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com), [udemy](www.udemy.com), and [udacity](www.udacity.com) are a few examples of these.
